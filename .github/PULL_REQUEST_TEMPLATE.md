## Creating a Pull Request
1. Always test the application to see if it works as intended with no additional bugs you may be adding!
2. State all the changes you made in the PR, not everyone will understand what you've done!

### Formatting Guidelines
- Methods should follow PascalFormat
- Try to use `var` where ever possible
